**MySQL Setup Notes**
The setup and schema can be seen under *db->schema.sql*. 
Here are a few commands I found useful to run on the sql instance in docker:

**select user, host from mysql.user;**
This will show you what users and what hosts each user has access to in this mysql instance.

**show grants for 'sdmay2042'@'%';**
This will show you what permissions the user has and for which databases in this mysql instance.

# MYSQL-NOTES

## ONE TIME ONLY STUFF
The following command was used to create the docker container
docker run --name=mysql-c \
--mount type=bind,src=/home/sdmay2042/db/my.cnf,dst=/etc/my.cnf \
--mount type=bind,src=/home/sdmay2042/db/data,dst=/var/lib/mysql \
-d mysql/mysql-server:8.0.19-1.1.15 

Note that my.cnf has to exist, and the data folder has to be empty for initialization.

I then ran 'docker ps' until the container appeared as healthy status.
Running 'docker logs mysql-c 2>&1 | grep GENERATED' will spit out the autogenerated root password
Next to set the root password login to mysql within the container
docker exec -it mysql1 mysql -uroot -p
Use the password from the above logs string. Next modify the autogenerated password to something memorable from within the mysql instance.
mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MyP@ssw0rd';

## STARTING THE CONTAINER
docker start mysql-c

## STOPPING THE CONTAINER
docker stop mysql-c

## ENTERING THE CONTAINER
docker exec -it mysql-c bash

## ENTERING THE INSTANCE
docker exec -it mysql-c mysql -uroot -p
